# Programming Protocol-Independent Packet Processors (P4)

P4 is a domain-specific programming language that is designed for specifying how network packets are processed by the data plane of a network device, such as a switch or a router. P4 is created to enable programmable packet forwarding and to make the behavior of network devices more flexible and customizable. It was originally described in a 2014 SIGCOMM CCR paper titled "Programming Protocol-Independent Packet Processors"—the alliterative name shortens to P4.

## P4 Characterisitcs

P4 language is **target independence**. This means that P4 programs can be compiled to run on different types of networking hardware or software targets, including ASICs, FPGAs, network processors, and software switches. These different types of machines are known as P4 `targets`, and each target must be provided along with a compiler that maps the P4 source code into a target switch model. The compiler may be embedded in the target device, an externally running software, or even a cloud service.

P4 language is **protocol independence**. It can be used to describe packet processing for any network protocol, not just a fixed set of protocols. This allows network operators to easily introduce and manage new protocols. The language has no native support for even common protocols such as IP, Ethernet, TCP, VXLAN, or MPLS. Instead, the P4 programmer describes the header formats and field names of the required protocols in the program, which are in turn interpreted and processed by the compiled program and target device.

## P4 Specification

**P4-14** is the original version of the P4 language, introduced in 2014. It was designed to be protocol-independent and to specify how network devices process packets. **P4-16** is a more advanced version of the P4 language, introduced in 2016. It builds on P4-14 by adding more powerful and expressive features, better support for modularity, and enhanced control flow capabilities. You can find P4-16 language specs in [here](https://p4.org/p4-spec/docs/P4-16-v1.0.0-spec.html).

## P4 Compiler

The **P4 compiler** is a crucial component in the P4 programming ecosystem. It translates P4 code, which defines packet processing logic, into a format that can be executed by target devices such as software switches, hardware switches, or other network devices. The most commonly used P4 compiler is `P4C`, which supports different backends to generate code for various targets.

The compiler converts the P4 code into an intermediate representation (IR) that can be optimized and transformed before being translated to the target-specific code. Based on the target device, the compiler generates the appropriate configuration files, binary code, or other necessary artifacts. For example, it can produce JSON files for the BMv2 software switch or P4Runtime configurations for hardware switches. The compiler performs optimizations on the P4 program to improve performance, such as reducing table sizes, minimizing memory usage, and optimizing pipeline stages. Follow [these](https://github.com/p4lang/p4c?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-p4c-from-source) instruction to install the `P4C` on your machine.

You can use the following invocation to show the supported **target,arch** pairs:

```bash
p4c --target-help

Supported targets in "target, arch" tuple:
ebpf-v1model
bmv2-v1model
bmv2-psa
bmv2-pna
dpdk-psa
```

Each tuple consists of a target (which represents the specific platform or software environment where the compiled P4 program will run) and an architecture (which defines the packet processing pipeline model used by that target).

## Supported P4 Compiler Targets and Architectures

- **bmv2-v1model**

    This is the most widely used target for development and simulation. It compiles P4 programs for the `Behavioral Model Version 2` (BMv2) switch using the v1model architecture. It's ideal for learning, testing, and debugging P4 programs in software using tools like Mininet. This model mimics how a P4 switch processes packets without requiring actual hardware. BMv2 is not designed for high-performance production use but rather for flexibility and ease of use.

- **bmv2-psa**

    Targets BMv2 using the `Portable Switch Architecture` (PSA), which is a more modern and modular architecture than v1model. PSA provides a standardized pipeline and is designed for portability across different hardware and software targets. It supports advanced features like multiple pipelines, meters, and extern blocks with well-defined interfaces.

- **bmv2-pna**

    Targets BMv2 using the `Portable NIC Architecture` (PNA), which is tailored for network interface cards (NICs) rather than full switches. PNA focuses on high-performance packet processing at the network edge and supports features relevant to smart NICs, such as queue management and precise timestamping.

- **dpdk-psa**

    Compiles P4 programs to run on `DPDK` (Data Plane Development Kit)-based platforms using the PSA architecture. This is intended for high-speed packet processing in software, often used in telecom and cloud networking. It leverages DPDK’s zero-copy and high-throughput capabilities to run P4 logic on general-purpose CPUs.

- **ebpf-v1model**

    This target compiles P4 programs for the `eBPF` (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) backend, using the v1model architecture. It allows deploying P4 programs within the Linux kernel via the eBPF infrastructure, enabling high-performance packet filtering, load balancing, and telemetry directly in the kernel without requiring external switches or hardware.
